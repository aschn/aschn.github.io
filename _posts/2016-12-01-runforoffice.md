I wrote a post for Forbes! My goal was to inspire ambitious women in their 20s and 30s to participate in government and consider career paths within elected office, starting at the local level. I decided to keep it nonpartisan, but the obvious subtext is that Clinton's loss should be a call to action for the rest of us (including people of other ages and genders). Participation in government is always important, and state and local governments will have a particularly vital role to play in the near term in resisting Trump's federal government. Also, I got to sneak in a bit of a rant about how startups are not the only, and hardly ever the best, way to "change the world" :)
