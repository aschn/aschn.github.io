## A human bio

For work, I'm best in jobs that are fundamentally about "why" and "what does it really mean when..." questions. I've felt this click for me in a range of roles, including science, product management, design, writing/editing, and teaching/training. I'm happy to be tasked with as much of the "what" and "how" work as necessary (including writing quite a lot of software) to figure out the right "why" questions to be asking, and to answer those questions. Thumbs up to best practices, good frameworks, and creative strategies.

Outside of work, I like dancing, food projects, podcasts, and volunteering with the [Unconscious Bias Project](http://unconsciousbiasproject.org/). Currently living in the East Bay CA with queer ladies and their adorable cats.
